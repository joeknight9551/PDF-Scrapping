President
Sally Lawson

Happy Fall breeders!

Its that time of year again, we
need to start thinking about
getting our rabbits ready for
winter. I’m sure not looking
forward to those frozen water
_} crocks. It’s also the time to

_ think about breeding for your
Spring Jr’s.

As you read this, we should all be home from the
100th ARBA convention in Louisville Kentucky. It
was a great one for sure! Congratulations to all
our Minnesota winners. | hope this convention
sparked some new thoughts on where you want
to go with your breeds. It sure did for me. Many
picked up new breeds and others picked up new
stock. | wish everyone great success with that.
Looking forward to next year’s convention being
held in Louisville, Kentucky again on October 26th
— 30th 2024.

| also want to congratulate our MN. State national
youth teams on a job well done. This was a first
experience for most of our youth. Some really
went out of their comfort zone and did amazing.
Thank you to the parents who helped with this as
well.

Keep those nest boxes full,
Sally

Vice President
Rick Stanoch

Hello

who took the time to cast
their ballot. | will have a lot of
work to do to fill the shoe
prints that Dale has left
behind. When you see Dale
be sure to thank him for all

: the work that he has done for
this great CLUB. There are also other great

| would like to thank everyone

members on this board that deserve a big round
of thanks for all that they do.

| come to this club with a lot of rabbit back ground
from 4-H county knowledge bowl judging teams,
county fairs, and judging county fairs through the
state. | have some experience on the business
side managing a school bus company. | am really
excited to be involved with taking this club into the
future with building our shows, and guiding our
youth in the best way possible.

Thank You
Rick

Happy Fall everyone!

This is my favorite time of year! |
have enjoyed going to a few shows
_, this fall and especially enjoyed our
state show. It was a great turnout. |
especially enjoyed giving all the
award winners a hard time making them
remember the tattoo numbers of their winning
rabbits. All in good fun.

| was excited about Sally Larson being reelected
as the MSRBA president and having Rick Stanoch
as our new Vice-President. Our membership is
still on the rise which brings me much joy! As we
approach the cool weather, | hope your buns stay
warm!

Until next time,
Hillary

Hello everyone, and happy fall!

I'd like to give a big shout out to this
year’s youth contest participants.
There were about 20 youth that
competed this year and more that
have reached out about next year. |
also would like to say how much |
appreciate the patience and

5
understanding of the youth members and their
families as | navigate through all of this year. So
thank you!

With that being said, | am happy to announce the
following results of this years’ Royalty Contests!

King: Caleb Lewis
Queen: Savannah Selin
Duke: Cody Herring
Duchess: Charlotte Wenzler
Lord: Arlo Feia
Princess: Louritta Lewis

| am also happy to announce that a good group
of our Minnesota Youth competed in some of the
youth events at the 100th ARBA Convention that
was held in Louisville, Kentucky this year. | am
SO proud of these youth for stepping out of their
comfort zones and trying new things but also for
being supportive of one another in the process,
no matter what the outcome may be. | have a lot
of learning to do for myself for next year, so | will
be digging a bit deeper into the youth contests for
you all next year. Until then, keep studying, keep
encouraging one another, and keep having fun.

Kristina

Hello Everyone:

Congratulations to everyone
who attended the 100th
ARBA Convention on their
placings, and to the kids also,
it is wonderful to see them
compete with their rabbits
and cavies along with the
other contests for the youth to

do.

While | love fall to a point, | am sad our garden is
pretty much finished and soon snow will be
knocking on the door. Still plan a few nights for

a bonfire in the backyard as we love making
Smores over the fire. Need to make some Hobo
packets to toss on also for a meal some night.
Have not had those since we last camped a few
i 4

years ago.

As some of you know | love history, especially
Medieval and Ancient Egypt. | decided to check
on some ancestry records that my mom had left
off on when she got sick and passed away. | also
had no luck on finding any information on Sierra’s
fathers sided years ago when | was looking also.
| was able to finally find what | was looking for,
actually way more (enough | need to invest in a
paper company LOL). | so far have been able to
trace her paternal ancestors to the 800’s and just
a hint of what | have found so far are a couple
Lord’s and Lady’s, a Duchess and a father and
son who died the same day and thought to be
Colonial Spies. There may be ties to the Stewarts
as in Mary Queen of Scots also, but just pulling
files for now, have not read in deep yet in the
references or notes. | did see a name that looked
strangely familiar and after doing a quick Google
search it turns out that person was known as
Charles I/Charles the Great or as Charlemagne
who ruled most of Western Europe and named
the First Emperor Of the Romans later to be
known as the Holy Roman Empire. So as you can
see there is going to be a lot of confirming
sources and names.

Anyway | would like to wish you all a Happy
Thanksgiving, Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year!!!

Holly

PS: This issue is packed with information,
especially for so many of our new members.

Happy Fall MSRBA
Members!

hy We have had a very busy fall
rabbit show season at Avon

* Hills Rabbitry. Princeton, MN
| State Show, Cambridge,

and on to the 100th ARBA

s Convention!

‘ It's going to feel weird not to
be heading off somewhere with rabbits for a few
months. The best thing about rabbit shows is
seeing & hugging old friends and meeting new
ones....we are indeed blessed with many special
friends!

Exhibitor points are included in this
bulletin from the following shows:

Heart of the Lakes August 12, 2023 Double

Open (Youth points have not been included

as the MSRBA is waiting on the club to pay

the tax due from those shows)

¢ Town & Country September 9, 2023 Double
Open & Double Youth

¢ MSRBA State Show September 23, 2023
Open & Youth (Double Points)

¢ MSRBA Directors Show September 24, 2023
Double Open & Double Youth

¢ Borderline September 30, 2023 Double Open

& Double Youth

As | was entering sweepstakes points, there were
a few topics | thought of that might be of interest
to you.

1. You receive sweepstakes points only on the
shows that are sanctioned with the MSRBA.
This means that the club that puts on the show
pays fees to the MSRBA, including a per rabbit
“tax” that covers insurance and a variety of
other administrative items, including prizes for
top sweepstakes winners.

2. Your MSRBA membership begins the day that
you pay your membership fee. You will start
earning points that day and at each MSRBA
sanctioned show until your membership
expires. Remember to keep an eye on your
membership dates.

. All co-breeders who are listed together on
show reports must EACH be MSRBA members
in order to get points for that show.

. Specialty shows must be sanctioned
separately from the all-breed shows that they
run concurrently with in order for exhibitors to
receive points for those shows.

5. When show secretaries finish entering the
show results into the software, they send
reports to me. The reports | receive include
ARBA Display Points by Breed, Breed Fur
Points & Specialty Club Placement. | enter the
information from these reports into a
spreadsheet | have created to calculate total
points. | then create a final sheet to report all of
the total rabbits shown for each breed and the
exhibitor points from shows up to that date.

Ny

You can find out lots of information about this
and all things MSRBA at our quarterly
meetings. Everyone is welcome to attend. The
next meeting will be Sunday, December 3 at
11am. It will be at The Side Bar & Grill, 15 Red
River Ave N in Cold Spring, MN

As always, don’t hesitate to send me a message
at sweepstakeschair@msrba.org if you have any
questions or concerns. Any membership
questions should be sent to secretary@msrba.org

May your nest boxes be filled with lots of
bouncing baby bunnies! Have a safe & wonderful
holiday season! See you in 2024!

Kerry
From your President Sally Larson:

It is with a very heavy heart that I need to inform the MSRBA Board and our members that
we have lost Kris Phelan-Antoine, our Youth Scholarship Committee Chair Person. She passed
away from a heart attack on the morning of October 9th, 2023. Please keep her family in
your thoughts and prayers in the days and weeks ahead as we morn her loss alongside them.

du.

Kristine Dorinda Phelan-Antoine
September 23, 1945 - October 9, 2023

Tribute from Marlys Schoenhals:

Kris and Bernie, along with their family raised and showed both Holland Lops and Netherland
Dwarfs and were part of the Surburban Twins Rabbit Club. They were always ready to share their
knowledge with new breeders, young and old alike. Many current breeders have many tales
involving their days with this family.

When the family lost Bernie in 2004, it ended their show career as Bernie and Kris had a pact
that if anything should happen to one of them, the other would retire from rabbits. Kris stopped
showing rabbits but she continued to be active with the MSRBA and all the friends she had made

along the way...... Goodbye Old Friend.

MSRBA General Membership Meeting
September 23, 2023

CALL TO ORDER: The meeting was called to order by President Sally Larson.

ROLL CALL: Clubs present were Borderline Rabbit Club, Central Minnesota Rabbit Club, Cedar River Rabbit Club, River
Lakes Rabbit Club, Rochester Area Rabbit Club, and We Be Rabbit Club. Not present were Heart of the Lakes Rabbit
Breeders Association and Town and Country Rabbit Club. Also present were officers, Sally Larson, Dale Zenk and Hillary
Zeppelin.

READING OF THE MINUTES: A motion was made by Borderline RC and seconded by River Lakes RC to accept the
minutes of the previous MSRBA board meeting as printed in the bulletin. Motion carried. A motion was also made by
River Lakes RC and seconded by Rochester Area RC to accept the minutes of the emergency meeting held on 9-9-2023 as
printed on the handout. Motion carried.

TREASURER’S REPORT: Secretary/Treasurer Hillary Zeppelin read the report. Account balances as of August 31, 2023
were as follows; Open Checking $4,759.64, General Savings $8,089.86, Sweepstakes Savings $6,302.81, Scholarship
Savings $12,962.19, and Banquet Savings $3,787.05. The balance for all open accounts was $35,901.55. The youth

COMMUNICATIONS AND BILLS: Member Pete Dudley asked about any outstanding bills. Secretary/Treasurer Hillary
Zeppelin reported there were a few outstanding bills due from the state show yet.

Committee Reports:

Audit Committee: Committee chair Sally Larson reported we are currently in the process of getting 2019 and 2020 audited.
It has been hard to find someone to do the audits. When completed there will be reports done by two different people.
The 2021 audit is unable to be done as we are missing half of the financials for that year. 2022 is due to be done by the end
of this calendar year. A member asked how we know money is not missing if we don’t have the full financial records from
2021? Sally Larson replied that we know everything that came in and out of the account. We just don’t have any receipts.
Another member asked why we can’t do the audit for the months that we have a record for. Sally Larson replied we don’t
have all the documentation necessary. When something like this happens you just have to work with it and that is what we
are trying to do.

Awards Committee: No report.

Bulletin Committee: Committee chair Dale Zenk reported you may have seen an increase in membership rates. That is
because of the bulletin. The cost has gone up and the membership dues cover that cost.

Constitution and By-Laws Committee: Committee chair Dale Zenk reported that the membership dues increases are in the
by-laws. It took a board vote to change those, and the updates should be accurate on the website.

Election Committee: Committee member Dale Zenk announced the results of the election. Newly elected officers were as
follows; Sally Larson president, Rick Stanoch vice president.

Hall of Fame Committee: Committee chair Richard Steinberg presented Marlys Schoenhal and Madelyn Beckstrom with the
Hall of fame awards for this year. Their pictures and write-up will be printed in the upcoming bulletin.

Historical Committee: Committee chair Richard Steinberg stated there were some scrapbooks in the showroom if people
wanted to take a look at them and get some giggles. Next year is the MSRBAs 75th anniversary so there are a lot of old
pictures in the scrapbooks. Sally Larson also added we have decided to have a history section in our bulletin so Richard will
be pulling a couple things out per issue to share.

Lifetime Members Committee: Committee chairperson Marlys Schoenhals stated there was nothing submitted for lifetime
members. There were no nominations. This award is not one that is given out every year. It is based on nominations and if
the nominee meets all the requirements.

Special Awards Committee: Committee chairperson Laura Pipenhagen explained what the Best rabbit of the year is and
awarded Open breeder Sally Larson with Best rabbit of the year with her Florida white “Riviera” and youth breeder Parker
Wilaby with the best rabbit of the year award with his Mini Rex “RD5S2.”

Scholarship Committee: Committee member Marlys Schoenhals announced that Peter Doroff, Grace Backes,

Lilli Schoenhals and Jessica Otto. They will all receive $500 scholarships. Also, a reminder that scholarships are not just for
the youth. Anyone can apply and can do so more than once.

LQ
Scholarship Auction Committee: Committee chairperson Richard Steinberg announced that the auction brought in
$2,610.00 before payouts.

State Fair Committee: No report.

Lakes RC will be hosting the State show next year in Owatonna.

calculated. So far, she has calculated the points for the Fergus Falls show. Feel free to call her with any questions.

— Arlo Feia. Thank you to all the youth that participated!

UNFINISHED BUSINESS: None

NEW BUSINESS: President Sally Larson explained how we configured awards this year. Sally proposed if the members
would want to initiate a minimum of 200 points to qualify or what the members are interested in. After much discussion
it was decided not to change anything at this time.

ADJOURNMENT: With no further business at hand a motion was made by Borderline Rabbit Club and seconded by
Cedar River Rabbit Club. Motion carried.

Respectfully submitted, Hillary Zeppelin, MSRBA Secretary Treasurer

Amendment to the June 2023 meeting minutes:

Dale Zenk motioned to have the youth account pay $2.00 towards each youth ticket sold. Rochester Area RC approved that motion

and was seconded by River Lakes RC. Motion carried.

Richard Steinberg motioned that the state show host club receives $.25 per entry to help bring interest to more clubs hosting the state

show. We Be RC approved that motion and River Lakes RC seconded. Motion carried.

Richard Steinberg motioned that we make a change to the state show rules as currently the host club is reimbursed up to $100.00 for
banquet decorations. With the rising prices it is suggested we bring that amount to $200.00. River Lakes RC motioned to approve this

change and Borderline RC seconded it. Motion carried.

Dale Zenk motioned to change the state show rules to reflect that the youth committee chair be responsible for the raffle table and not
the Vice President as it currently states. River Lakes RC motioned to approve this change and We Be RC seconded it. Motion carried.

It's Your Shing

This is your hobby, Don't let others dictate what you should do with
it. If you want to show a specific breed, do it! It's your thing. If you want to
show several different breeds, do it! It's your thing. If you started showing in
open and your kids are old enough now and you want them to start showing
in youth making sure once you move them to youth that they stay there and
are not shown by you in open again. Do It! It's your thing. If you showed in
youth and aged out, but your siblings have not and want to keep
showing. Let them, Do It! It's your thing. If your kids are done showing and
were in youth by all means keep your line going and move them to open
and keep them on the tables in your name. You can do that! It's your thing.
You want to show at a specific show, don't want to travel far to shows, want
to stay in the state to show. Do what you want. It's your thing.

The main purpose of this letter is to remind people that this is a
hobby, It's your hobby, they are your rabbits. It's your thing!!!! Do as you
want to do. For those of you that are overly concerned about what others do
with their hobby, remember It's their hobby. You do you and what's best for
you, Let them do theirs and what's best for them. It's their thing!!!

Sally Larson- MSRBA President

Please keep in mind ARBA Show Rule section 30

All animals must be the bonafide property of the exhibitor(s) prior to entry. Each
owner's personal name(s) must be listed on the entry form, but a rabbitry name
may be added, if applicable, when entering shows. It will be the responsibility of the
owner(s) and Show Committee to not submit or accept an entry in family or rabbitry
names. The determination / confirmation of ownership is the responsibility of the
exhibitor.

(A) In case of disqualification under this rule, other exhibitors shall, if qualified, be
moved up on the list of winners.

Basically this means, Any rabbit or cavy entered in an ARBA sanctioned show must
be entered with the full names of all owners listed as the exhibitors. Rabbitry or
family names are not sufficient, it must be the first and last name of every person
who owns a rabbit. If | have a rabbit on my property that I’m borrowing or is there
for any reason, should | show said rabbit | must enter it in the owner's

name. Owner=Exhibitor, always and forever, this is non-negotiable. Obviously,
any animal co-owned with any party 19 years of age or older can only be exhibited
in Open shows.

Madelyn Beckstrom

Marlys Schoenhals

Madelyn started in Rabbits when her daughter Alissa was 9 years old and got her first French
Lop. In 1984 Madelyn got her own start in rabbits with her first Polish. That is also the year
she joined Rochester Area Rabbit Club, and is now a lifetime member. Madelyn has held
several officer positions within the many years of being a member. Around the same time

Madelyn became a member of the MSRBA and was the bulletin editor for 15 years. Her and

her husband Carl were awarded a Lifetime membership with the club. Madelyn was the Rab-
bit project leader for Dodge County for 38 years, helped with Mn State fair judging contest
and got the open class Rabbit show started in the county. Madelyn is a Dodge County fair

Lifetime and Hall of Fame member. Madelyn got her ARBA registrar license in 1992 and has
recently retired her license in 2023. Madelyn holds a Lifetime membership with the ARBA.

Madelyn thanks her daughter Alissa for getting her involved in the rabbit world were she has

met the most amazing people.

Marlys Schoenhals has been Inducted into the MSRBA Hall of Fame for her 30 plus years of
membership and her contributions to the club. She started in rabbits in the mid 1980's with
Polish, Holland Lops, Dwarf Hotot and Mini Rex. She was also part of the Lionhead develop-
ment team. She currently raises Polish, Holland Lops, Fuzzy Lops and works with Lillie on
Mini Rex. She has been a rep for Anoka County Rabbit Club and Boarderline Rabbit Club.
She has held a long standing seat on the Scholarship Committee and State Fair Committee.
She strives to support MSRBA Charter Clubs and Shows. She is a stickler for following the
rules and knowing that gives every MSRBA member equal opportunities to succeed with their
hobby. We all know Marlys to go above and beyond to help when she sees something thats
needing to be done. Many members can share positive moments with Marlys.

What is a Specialty Show???
We have a lot of new members!
Showing rabbits is confusing when you’re new, so here’s the scoop on Specialty Shows.

A Specialty Show is a type of ARBA Show sanction that limits the animals that can be shown under
the sanction. There are breed specialty show sanctions that are issued for the exhibition of the breeds
covered by each National Specialty Club. A Rex Specialty would just cover Rex, however a Satin
Specialty would cover Satin as well as Mini Satin, since they are the same specialty club. Likewise,
all Angoras are covered by one sanction, as well as French and English Lops. A commercial specialty
covers the commercial classes, and a Rare-Breed Specialty covers only the breeds determined to be
“rare” by the annual listing of the Livestock Conservancy.

Specialty Shows are often held in conjunction with All-Breed shows. Often, they serve as an incentive
to breeders to show and earn more points and legs due to the opportunity to exhibit multiple times in
a day or weekend. These shows can be hosted by the All-breed Club that’s hosting the main show, or
a stand-alone Specialty Club for the breed(s) sanctioned. All-breed clubs often select the most
popular breeds from previous shows and reward them with a Specialty Show for their previous entry
support.

*** Specialty shows do not automatically earn MSRBA Sweepstakes points, it is not covered
under the all-breed sanction. A Specialty Show must be sanctioned separately with ARBA,
MSRBA and the breed club (if a breed specific specialty show). ***

Area Specialty Clubs sometimes hold their own shows, banding together with other Specialty Clubs to
share facility rent and judge fees, to hold “cluster” shows that have no all-breed show. Specialty Clubs
are not allowed to request All-Breed sanctions from ARBA.

Specialty Clubs also sometimes ask local clubs for permission to hold a Specialty show in conjunction
with their all-breed shows. There may be agreements made for the Specialty club to cover the cost of
their judge, awards, part of the building rent, etc.

Specialty Clubs must bear in mind that although a Specialty Show may help a Local Club draw more
entries, they are in no way obligated to allow another club to host a show in conjunction with their
own. There is risk involved with insurance for the venue, and also, splitting up the entries to separate
clubs and assuring the show reports are submitted on time are worries some clubs prefer not to be
saddled with. If a Local Club allows a Specialty Club to host a show in conjunction with their own,
they can be “guilty by association” if reports are late- which ultimately can damage their reputation.
Co-hosting is a privilege and Specialty Clubs should do everything they can to work together with
Local Clubs to earn their good stead.

If you’re looking to get more for your show weekend, hosting a Specialty Show might be a great
opportunity.

HOW TO ENTER A RABBIT SHOW

For new members who have little show experience, here are some suggestions to help you determine where
and when shows are that you may not have thought about looking for or realized are out there.

FIND A SHOW

As a beginner looking for shows to attend, it is helpful to know what ARBA District you are in (We are District 3 - lowa,
Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin). You can go to ARBA’s website and search through their
show listings by state or district, it depends how far you want to travel to attend shows. Once you find a show you want to
attend on the list, look to the far right column as it will have a catalog attached you can click on for all relivent show
information. If one is not attached you can email the show secretary for more information as they are the one who handle
all email communications and entries before and after the show. Sometimes you can the show or event info on Facebook

or if the host club has a website. The secretary or the show catalog will usually include info regarding location, number of
shows (such as double open/double youth etc), check-in, entry prices, how to enter shows with due dates, sanctioned breeds,
starting breeds, venders coming to the show, raffle events, etc.

Note you do not typically need to be an ARBA member to show at shows (exception would be the ARBA Annual Convention
in the fall). If there is more than a single show that day, be sure to designate what rabbits are entered in what show. For
example if it is a double Open and you want to show both shows and you can submit entries via email than break it down
into two sections in the email with titles like Entries for Show A/1 and Entries for Show B/2 and list the information needed
for each rabbit under the appropriate show. (I usually show a rabbit in each show so that would be two entries per rabbit
for me).

PICK YOUR RABBITS

Once you find a show and know the show dates and entry deadlines what you will want to do is decide who you want to
take to show at that show. | try to do this a couple days before the entry deadline. What we do is go through our herd, trim
nails, check for disqualifations (teeth, broken or damaged nails, moderate molt/shedding, missing hair, etc) and make a

list of who will be going with a couple of alternates just in case we need to make a change before the final make changes
deadline. Once that is all done and the entry change deadline is past, the night before we leave we go through and again
check nails and trim if needed, check for any staining to the fur and if anyone is molting who wasn’t before, etc. We also
set up our carry cages with bedding/pads in the trays, a bit of grass hay, and make sure there are food and water cups
for them. We put the rabbits info on the holes so we know who is who and what class they are going in (ear number, breed,
variety with age and gender class: ex: BH1 23, Rex, Otter Jr Doe). Our carry cages have a card holder over each hole (2
or 3 hole carriers)and we just write on masking tape the info for each hole, it is easy to replace each show, just tear the
tape off after the show and it will be ready to go for the next show. Then just before we leave, we pack things we are
taking (chairs, grooming table and tools, extra feed, water and hay if staying overnight or a couple of nights, along with
paperwork for each rabbit going including records and pedigrees especially if | am taking extra rabbits to sell. Be sure to
include all your entry forms with that paperwork along with the address/directions to the show, phone charger, and cash for
meals or supplies venders etc. The rabbits are the last thing we do, they go into their carriers and are loaded into the
vehicle, we do have a wheeled cart that we use so that is the very last thing put in (so first thing out once we get to the
show). Then it is road trip time lol.

ONCE AT THE SHOW

Once we arrive, | then go in with the paperwork and chairs to get us checked in while my daughter starts to load rabbits
from the vehicle to the wheeled cart to bring into the show venue. | will also try and find a spot to set up/stage our rabbits
from. Once she knows where our spot is, | go around and check where venders are set up, what breeds are designated to
what table for judging if that has been done in advance by the host club. Then we settle in and wait for our breeds to be
called to the tables and let the fun begin!

SHOWING TIPS AND SHOW ETIQUETTE

Here are some tips and basic etiquette when showing that helps you, the host club, and judges to keep things running
smoothly throughout the day.

Arrive at the show venue early, some clubs are very strict on their start times and if you are 10 minutes late you will not be
able to put your breeds up the first show especially if you are entering any starting breeds as they are the first to hit the

t |

judges tables due to the expected number of entries for those breeds. | try to make the shows 30 to 60 minutes early to
get set up and figure out what breeds will be on what tables and to double check our rabbits for last minute attention and
to make sure they all have a bit of water in their cups.

If you can and want to help out, offer to write for the judges for your breeds or if they need a writter at another table
bettween your breed/s. If you do not know how, judges usually are receptive to walk you through it really quick, or ask
another writter to show you what to do. It is easy to do and you can learn a lot about other breeds too. Judges and host
clubs really appreciate those who step up to help write for the judges.

You will want to listen to the judges comments on your rabbits to see if there is something you want or need to improve in
your breeding program. Do not take any comments to personally at shows and respect the judges opinion even if you
disagree, they are only judging what is put in front of them on that particular day. We keep notes on each rabbit each
show (or if remark cards are used we get the exhibitor copy) and we compair them to see if the same comments from
multiple judges show up. That helps tell us what traits to look for in future breeding stock to improve our show herd.

Be ready to show when your class is called. This sounds easy but when you show more than one breed it can get hectic to
say the least when you have more than one breed called at the same time on two or more tables let alone from one end of
the show room to the other. In my experience most other exhibitors are happy to help each other out in these types of
instances. My daughter was showing 3 breeds for awhile, her Checker Giant and her Himalayan and her Rex were all
called at the same time in youth at a few shows. She asked another family if their kids could put her Rex on the table while
she was putting the other two up on tables on the other side of the show room. As soon as the other two breeds were done
she would come back and finish up her Rex entries. She would always get the kids a treat or help them out the rest of the
day if they needed it . Also, it is a great way to meet new friends for the first time. Be on time to the table once breed is
called, | have seen some be late on purpose hoping that some rabbits have been dismissed from the table hoping to get
brtter placings. Many times if a person is consistantly late at each table under the same judge at several shows they will not
allow that exhibitor to put ther rabbits up to be evaluated. Being late causing several calls to bring rabbits up causing
delayed judging which make for a much longer day when it is a double or triple show. Another subtle reason (or so they
think) is to try to let the judge know whose rabbit is going on the table (against ARBA show rules) which is why many times
judges take a break while exhibitors get their rabbits up on the tables when breeds are called for.

Speaking of kids, there have been several shows where parents are at the show tables and not paying attention to what
their kids are doing, running wild and causing issues with other exhibitors. Please keep an eye on your kids if you have any,
be sure they are not causing issues for others (getting in the way, harrassing rabbits or other kids, making sure they are not
vandalizing anything especially in the bathrooms). The show room can be crowded with people and rabbits and sometimes
exhibitors with a service animal. Kids should not be running throughout the show room bumping into people, rabbit carriers,
screaming and yelling, distracting service animals, and just causing plain maham. In many instances clubs will include rules
about this and putting any financal repercutions onto the parents for any damages the kids cause to the venue.

A big thing is some exhibitors (rare and far between) who will bring sick rabbits to show because with pre-entry shows they
don’t want to be out that miniscule show fees for that one rabbit. | would rather loose the small amount of entry fees for a
less than 100% healthy animal then bring it and possibly make sick or kill someone elses animal that may have cost them
over $100 to purchase for their program. When we are done showing we put the rabbits that were at the show in a
seperate building for 30 days quarantine. All carriers and feed cups are cleaned and sprayed with discinfectant
according to the directions on the container, then rinsed a final time and left to dry in the sun when possible. Once dry they
are put back together and put away till the next show.

Rabbits with disqualifications or rabbits in molt should not be entered into a show, they will not place well or at all. If a
rabbit is in the very end stages of a molt that may be fine but may still get points penalized and possibly dropped a
placing but that is up to the judge. If you have a rabbit with known disqualification based on color and for example and
over zelous mom at birth cleaning her kits and nipping the tip of a ear off and you want a judge or two’s oppion on the
rabbit’s quality to keep for breeding stock or sell/cull that is fine to ask them to evaluate the rabbit between shows or after
the shows are finished. One example is we had a doe that to me looked good, only fault is that she had more white than
allowed for brokens in her breed. | wanted to verify my thoughts on her quality (we were fairly new to the breed-only had
them for two years) to see if she would be worth keeping to breed to a solid color buck to improve the quality more on the
future litters. They said she was fair but would have to look for a very specific type of buck to cross on, she went down the

road in the end as ot would not have helped our herd to possibly spend months finding what we needed in our price range.

Minnesota State Rabbit Breeders Association

The MSRBA was first chartered with the ARBA in September 1949. We celebrated our 50th (Golden) anniversary at our State
Convention and Banquet in September of 1999. We are an organization of approximately 500 rabbit and cavy raisers, joining together
to encourage and promote the breeding of standard breed animals, to keep rabbit interest alive, and to coordinate rabbit activities in
Minnesota.

We have an annual sweepstakes contest with awards given at our Awards Banquet, which occurs on Saturday night of our
Minnesota State Show and Convention weekend. This allows our members to compete for show points and awards with other
members who raise and show the same breeds they do. Our sweepstakes run from July 1st through June 30th of the following year
and the awards are given out in September of that year. The number of awards given per breed is dependent upon the number of
animals shown in that breed during the sweepstakes season with 5 as the maximum number given per breed.

Our general membership meeting is also held during our Awards Banquet. A Board of Directors conducts business during the
year. One director is elected by each local, affiliated all breed club to represent them.

A bulletin (our newsletter) is sent to members four times a year, which lists upcoming shows, show reports, most show
catalogs, news of rabbit friends and local clubs, information on breeds and raising rabbits, as well as ads that tell who raises which
breeds and where they are located.
